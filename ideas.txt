you know, like a library, we're already turning the books for short info. We can also make this 3d, and then, show the books mainly from their right/left sides rather than like front/back (general info/short info on the card) as 3rd side. it could be good... But I'm already trying things that takes me quite some time, yet I gotta go on...
